Sample Test Driven Development Environment
==========================================

Supplement to Beginning JavaScript Course

Setup
-----

- Copy the files in this directory.

- Open a file browser and open the run-unit-tests.html file. You
  should see the QUnit tests ran OK.

- Open another file browser and select the files: test-functions.js
  and functions.js  You can set the file browser to open js files with
  "code" or "Notepad".

Start development cycle
-----------------------

- Write a test that fails. If possible only define one assertion. Run
  the test. If it doesn't fail then rewrite the test.

- Write the code that makes the test pass.  What is the smallest
  change you can make to make the test pass? code/test until the test
  passes.

- Cleanup and Refactor the functional code and the test
  code. refactor/test until the test passes. Then run all the tests.

- Repeat

When you write code this way you will have immediate feedback and you
will be able to refactor your code anytime after all tests pass.
